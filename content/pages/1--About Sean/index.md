### We are Sean:

As you can see, We are not the most experienced I.T guys in the world. However,
here is what **we are**, two guys who wanted to change their careers. We were both stuck
going through the motions in jobs we didn't enjoy. We both decided we needed to do something
to get into I.T, and we decided to push ourselves to learn more every day.

Now we're making a website, to help you, **for free** to do the same as us. If you are
unhappy with your work, your life, your career, then go through our tutorials and you too can get into I.T work and make the change you currently wish for. We will help you as much as we can. There will be regular updates to our tutorials, you can contact us on our [slack](https://sean-will-help-you.slack.com/), [gmail](mailto:seanwillhelpyou@gmail.com),
